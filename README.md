# PasPdf
Object Pascal implementation of a simple PDF lexer (work in progress)

## Status
So far this code is able to parse mostly simple PDF file without an error. It does not yet evaluate the stored data nor does it display anything.

However, this code can be used in the future to build more complex tools.

For me the motivation was to extract content automatically from a pile of PDF files. This was the reason why I wrote the code so far.
